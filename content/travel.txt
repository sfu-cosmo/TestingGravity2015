Title: Getting to Vancouver

Subtitle: By Air

Vancouver International Airport (YVR) is well connected to major airports in Asia and Europe and cities throughout Canada and USA. Excellent deals, particularly from Europe, can often be found on holiday airlines, such as Air Transat and Thomas Cook. The best option for getting from YVR to the city is via Sky Train.

Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre (CXH) is a seaplane terminal located within a 10 min walk from SFU Harbour Centre. An exciting option for people arriving from the University of Victoria, assuming the weather collaborates.

Bellingham International Airport (BLI), across the US border, is about 85 km (53 miles) away from downtown Vancouver. Flying to BLI can be an inexpensive option if travelling from cities on the west coast of the US.

Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) is 250 km (153 miles) away from downtown Vancouver. Flying to SEA can be a more economical option, even after taking the cost of the rental car into account.

US border crossing times depend on the time of the day. 10-20 mins wait is normal during non-peak times, but can easily be an hour if you happen to venture at the wrong time. You can get an idea about the crossing time statistics on various websites.
