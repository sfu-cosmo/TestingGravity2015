Dear Colleague,

We are organizing a 3 day workshop at SFU Harbour Centre in Vancouver, January 15-17, 2015, on various ways of testing gravity - cosmological, astrophysical and terrestrial. This a topical theme, in part because of the growing interest in modified gravity theories motivated by the unexplained nature of dark matter and dark energy, and in part by improving technologies that open opportunities for new types of tests. 

The workshop will bring together experimentalists, observers and theorists, with a mixture of invited and contributed talks, and plenty of time for discussions. Topics will include

- Pulsars, black holes and other astrophysical tests
- Gravitational wave detectors
- Terrestrial tests, gravity on short distances
- Cosmological probes - CMB, 21cm, redshift surveys, weak lensing
- Modified gravity theories
- Model-independent frameworks for testing gravity 

We are also holding a one-day school on Wednesday, January 14, that will provide pedagogical introductions into the main topics discussed at the workshop.

The registration for the workshop and the school is now open and available via the workshop website:

Travel advice and local information will appear soon. 

We hope that you will consider coming to our workshop and will appreciate if you forward this announcement to your colleagues, including postdocs and graduate students.

Sincerely,

The Scientific Organizing Committee: Andrei Frolov, Makoto Fujiwara, Ruediger Picker, Levon Pogosian, Maxim Pospelov, Dimitrios Psaltis and Douglas Scott
